# Discussion/Conclusions

## Limitations
### Assumptions
- Explore assumptions such as First neighbors are mainly considered in this scheme.
  
### Automated Bonding Prediction

## For Future Implementation
### Extending modularity to metal FODs?
- Talk about possible parametrization of the *Triaugmented Triangular Prism* composed of 9 FODs.

### Spin-Unpolarized Prediction
