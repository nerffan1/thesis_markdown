# Validity of FOD Prediction
Explore the predictions done by FODLego

## Comparison of Heuristic FODs to FLOSIC-Optimized FODs
- **TODO:**
  - Create scatter plots for different parameters described in the scheme of previous section.

## Comparison to FOD-MC
## Biasing Predictions after Sampling (?)
- - Assuming data follows certain trends, we can further modify the predictions used in FODLego. For example, the tightening of closed shells in heavier atoms in the presence of the next shell closed.
