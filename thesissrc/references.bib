abstract = {Bond orders and formal charges are fundamental chemical descriptors. In cheminformatic applications it is necessary to be able to assign these properties to a given molecular structure automatically, given minimal input information. Here we describe a method for determining the bond order and formal charge assignments from only the atom types and connectivity. Our method utilises a graph theoretical description of electron positions. Each electron position assignment is scored according to lookup tables of atomic and bond dissociation energies derived from quantum chemical calculations. We tested three different optimisation methods—local optimisation, an A* pathfinding method, and an FPT optimisation method utilising tree decompositions—for finding the best electron position assignment, from which the bond orders and formal charges are extracted. We show that our method can assign bond orders and formal charges at a high degree of accuracy across a wide range of molecules from two different databases, and that the FPT algorithm provides the best combination of speed and accuracy.}

We verify the new formulation within the generalized Slater scheme by computing atomization energies and ionization potentials of selected molecules and comparing to those obtained by existing FLOSIC implementations in Gaussian based codes. The results show good agreement between the two formulations, with new real-space results somewhat closer to experiment on average for the systems considered. We also obtain the ionization potentials and atomization energies by scaling down the Slater statistical average of SIC potentials. The results show that scaling down the average SIC potential improves both atomization energies and ionization potentials, bringing them closer to experiment. Finally, we verify the present formulation by calculating the barrier heights of chemical reactions in the BH6 dataset, where significant improvements are obtained relative to Gaussian based FLOSIC results.}",

Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid, generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but computationally expensive post-Hartree–Fock approaches multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] as well as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study of very large scale systems with vastly improved results.}",

author = {Yamamoto, Yoh and Baruah, Tunna and Chang, Po-Hao and Romero, Selim and Zope, Rajendra R.},
abstractNote = {Recently proposed local self-interaction correction (LSIC) method [Zope et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 214108 (2019)] is a one-electron self-interaction-correction (SIC) method that uses an iso-orbital indicator to apply the SIC at each point in space by scaling the exchange–correlation and Coulomb energy densities. The LSIC method is exact for the one-electron densities, also recovers the uniform electron gas limit of the uncorrected density functional approximation, and reduces to the well-known Perdew–Zunger SIC (PZSIC) method as a special case. This article presents the self-consistent implementation of the LSIC method using the ratio of Weizsäcker and Kohn–Sham kinetic energy densities as an iso-orbital indicator. The atomic forces as well as the forces on the Fermi-Löwdin orbitals are also implemented for the LSIC energy functional. Results show that LSIC with the simplest local spin density functional predicts atomization energies of the AE6 dataset better than some of the most widely used generalized-gradient-approximation (GGA) functional [e.g., Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)] and barrier heights of the BH6 database better than some of the most widely used hybrid functionals (e.g., PBE0 and B3LYP). The LSIC method [a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.008 Å] predicts bond lengths of a small set of molecules better than the PZSIC-LSDA (MAE 0.042 Å) and LSDA (0.011 Å). This work shows that accurate results can be obtained from the simplest density functional by removing the self-interaction-errors using an appropriately designed SIC method.},

abstract = {Popular local, semilocal, and hybrid density functional approximations to the exchange-correlation energy of a many-electron ground state make a one-electron self-interaction error which can be removed by its orbital-by-orbital subtraction from the total energy, as proposed by Perdew and Zunger in 1981. This makes the functional exact for all one-electron ground states, but it does much more as well: It greatly improves the description of negative ions, the dissociation curves of radical molecules and of all heteronuclear molecules, the barrier heights for chemical reactions, charge-transfer energies, etc. PZ SIC even led to the later discovery of an exact property, the derivative discontinuity of the energy. It is also used to understand strong correlation, which is beyond the reach of semilocal approximations. The paradox of SIC is that equilibrium properties of molecules and solids, including atomization energies and equilibrium geometries, are at best only slightly improved and more typically worsened by it, especially as we pass from local to semilocal and hybrid functionals which by themselves provide a ladder of increasing accuracy for these equilibrium properties. The reason for this puzzling ambivalence remains unknown. In this speculative chapter, we suggest that the problem arises because the uncorrected functionals provide an inadequate description of compact but noded one-electron orbital densities. We suggest that a meta-generalized gradient approximation designed to satisfy a tight lower bound on the exchange energy of a one-electron density could resolve the paradox, providing after self-interaction correction the first practical “density functional theory of almost everything.”}

We show that a bond order derived from these FODs agrees well with reference values, and highlight that optimized FOD positions used within the Fermi-Löwdin orbital self-interaction correction (FLO-SIC) method correspond to expectations from Linnett's double-quartet theory, which is an extension of Lewis theory. This observation is independent of the underlying exchange-correlation functional, which is shown using the local spin density approximation, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and the strongly constrained and appropriately normed meta-GGA. To make FOD positions generally accessible, we propose and discuss four independent methods for the generation of Fermi-orbital descriptors, their implementation as well as their advantages and drawbacks. In particular, we introduce a re-implementation of the electron force field, an approach based on the centers of mass of orbital densities, a Monte Carlo-based algorithm, and a method based on Lewis-like bonding information.
